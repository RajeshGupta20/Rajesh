          Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published
          by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve
          Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy
          #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been
          featured in films, television shows, video games, and plays.
          Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt
          May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary
          Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal
          with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him
          many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson,
          and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and
          the Black Cat; and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and
          Venom. In his origin story, he gets spider-related abilities from a
          bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces,
          superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with his
          "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices
          that shoot artificial spider webs of his own design.

          Deadpool is a fictional character appearing in American comic books
          published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Fabian Nicieza and
          artist/writer Rob Liefeld, the character first appeared in New Mutants
          #98 (cover-dated Feb. 1991). Initially, Deadpool was depicted as a
          supervillain when he made his first appearance in The New Mutants and
          later in issues of X-Force, but later evolved into his more
          recognizable antiheroic persona. Deadpool, whose real name is Wade
          Winston Wilson, is a disfigured mercenary with the superhuman ability
          of regeneration and physical prowess. The character is known as the
          "Merc with a Mouth" because of his tendency to talk and joke
          constantly, including breaking the fourth wall for humorous effect and
          running gags.
